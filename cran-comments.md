## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* change 'http' to 'https' into a 'README.md' URL.

* Add the 'earth' package payload in the examples where it was 
  needed, to improve readability.

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 4.0.3
* windows-x86_64-devel (r-devel)
* fedora-clang-devel (r-devel)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. 

There was 1 NOTE:
